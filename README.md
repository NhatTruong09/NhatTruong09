- 👋 Hi, I’m @NhatTruong09
- 👀 I’m interested in the " How to create a reference page", " design the presentation slides in the Powerpoint", and " Argument essay" class. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Introduction to Science and Technology at RMIT university. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me by email (s3915114@rmit.edu.vn) and Micorsoft teams.
 -This is my second-week studying Introduction to Science and Technology. 
 -Action plan to improve my skills: Try to design the presentation slide, and reference page every week. 
 + I will try to design any slides about a lesson in class for around an hour every Friday morning. Then I will give it to my friends or lecturer to check is it ok and give me some advice to help me can fix them more clearly.
 + I will try to read the book and find any information from the internet. Then I try to make a reference page and check it with example citation on the Hardvard of the RMIT university page for around 1 hour very Friday afternoon.
